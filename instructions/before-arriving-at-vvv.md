- If you're not a _GitHubber_ yet, please [**sign up for GitHub**](https://github.com/join) (it's free).
  We're going to use [**GitHub**](https://github.com) and [**GitHub Education**](https://education.github.com) extensively during the school for hosting code and material so as collaborate all together ✨

#### A.O.B.
- How to trim (survive) [GitHub notifications](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notifications) 🔔. Disabling them all is not an option 😏 In short, you can subscribe/unsubscribe to conversations in multiple ways, the most relevant being [per **repository**](https://help.github.com/articles/unwatching-repositories) or [per **issue**](https://help.github.com/articles/unsubscribing-from-conversations).
- We have also an active community on [![iCub Research](http://ssl.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-32.png)](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/116897884020660435466?prsrc=3) you might want to subscribe to 😛.
