# Before arriving at VVV

- If you're not a _GitHubber_ yet, please [**sign up for GitHub**](https://github.com/join) (it's free).
  We're going to use [**GitHub**](https://github.com) and [**GitHub Education**](https://education.github.com) extensively during the school for hosting code and material so as collaborate all together ✨

   - _Email_ (can be kept hidden)
   - _Picture_ (not really required 😉)

All these info will help us find you on GitHub even if your _fancy username_ won't give enough hints 😄.
