# How to set up a VVVYY School

**YY** is the year (e.g. 17, 18...)

Everything is mostly done, since we can  [**duplicate** the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/#mirroring-a-repository) **vvv{yy-1}** (e.g. [vvv17](https://github.com/vvv-school/vvv17)) into **vvvyy**.

Then, do the following steps:
- Within [vvv-school](https://github/vvv-school), [create two **teams**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-team): **vvvyy-teachers** and **vvvyy-students**. Start off filling in the teachers for the time being. Remember that teams visibility is restricted to the organization's member.
- Replace all the links in the **README.md**.
- Create a [**welcome issue**](https://github.com/vvv-school/vvv17/issues/1) in **Q&A**. Don't forget to replace links therein.
- In the **wiki**, create just one page containing the **instructions to follow before arriving at VVV** and link it from within the home page. We have a [**template**](../instructions/before-arriving-at-vvv.md) for it, but you would need to tailor it a bit in order to put correct links to resources (e.g. new Q&A, new mailing list...). If there are instructions that are likely to be reused in the future schools, don't forget to **update the template** accordingly.
